Will's father was the owner of a large marketing business. Because of this, he has been exposed to marketing all his life. He is a very outgoing and extroverted person who loves sharing his view of things. This helps with his career. Captivate Interiors are known for their bright and eye-catching advertisements, and Will is responsible for that. After multiple surveys, the business found that most of their customers were their customers due to the adverts. This is how come Will has been on the team for a very long time.
